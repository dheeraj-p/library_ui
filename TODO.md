### To Create a Working Version

- [x] Implement feature to borrow books
- [x] Fetch and display currently reading book.
- [ ] Onboard new user on signin
- [ ] Protect Admin only routes
- [ ] Add scanner and UI to return book
- [ ] Display "all books" in a lazy-loading manner (use pagination internally)
- [ ] Show full details of book in a new screen including, who all are reading that book
- [ ] Add search field in "All books" screen to search by name
- [ ] Only allow TW domain in authentication

### For Future

- [ ] Refactor screens and figure out how react router can be used effectively.
